There has always been an itch, a drive, a desire to dive into software engineering. I've always been captivated by computers, and fascinated by how they work. Yet coding always seemed too technical, too challenging, and too unforgiving for myself. It's clear that this perspective is not wholly accurate, but it did influence my decision to not initially pursue learning to code. My reluctance to learn coding didn't temper my passion for computers, but it caused me to take a more generalist approach. I took a broader view of what software engineering can do, and how it can solve problems that I face on a daily basis. It's been great to have developed this perspective, but it still prevented me from diving headlong into and solving these problems on my own. It meant relying too much on others, and not on myself to solve my own problems. This left me at an impasse. 

It was at this point that I began to explore what it really meant to be a software engineer. Did it really entail having an encyclopedic knowledge of every software term ever created? Absolutely not! Did it mean having a firm enough grip on the "language" so that you can create elegant prosaic code? Maybe! 

This shift in view helped me realize that software engineering had more in common with my love for language (in particular Latin and Ancient Greek) than it did with pure mathematics. In each situation, you're taking a group of key vocabulary, and arranging them in a way that can be interpreted by a computer or translated by a peer. Additionally, coding and classics both allow for more syntactical wiggle room than a language like English. There are suggested "best practices", but an author and a coder can craft statements based on their implementation of the language. 

I realized that this line of work could be for me. I had discussions with friends and family (software engineers or not) and eventually decided that pursuing this track would be the perfect path for myself. I am only beginning this adventure, and there is much more to do, to see and to learn, but I'm excited at meeting the challenge head-on and seeing how I can continue to blend these two passions together.
